The app developed was designed to streamline inventory management for small to medium-sized business owners. Its primary goal was to address user needs for tracking stock levels, managing product information, and generating reports on inventory status efficiently. The app aims to eliminate manual tracking errors, save time, and provide insights into inventory trends. 

Screens and Features:

Home/Dashboard: Shows an overview of inventory levels and alerts for low stock. 

Product List: Enables users to show all inventory items, with search and filter capabilities. 

Product Details: Allows for viewing and editing detailed information about each item. 

Reports: Generates reports on inventory status, sales, and other analytics. 

The UI was designed with simplicity in mind, using clear labels and intuitive navigation to ensure users could easily find and use features without extensive training. Considerations were made for text size, color contrast, and button sizes to accommodate diverse user needs. Immediate feedback was provided for user actions (e.g., saving changes, or updating stock levels) to confirm successful operations. The designs were successful because they directly addressed the user's primary needs with minimal complexity, reducing the learning curve and enhancing the overall user experience. 

The app was coded using a combination of Kotlin for Android development and Jetpack Compose for UI components, emphasizing modularity and reusability. Breaking down the app into modular components made it easier to manage development, test individual pieces, and reuse code. Using Git for version control allowed for tracking changes, and experimenting with new features safely. 

Functional testing was conducted both manually and through unit tests to ensure code reliability. Manual testing involved running the app on various devices to check UI elements and user flows, while unit tests followed on logic and data handling. This process was crucial for identifying bugs, ensuring the app met user requirements, and confirming that changes didn't introduce new issues. Testing revealed the importance of coverage edge cases and the need for continuous testing throughout development. 

A significant challenge was ensuring the app's performance and responsiveness when handling large inventory datasets. Innovation came in optimizing data retrieval and updates, implementing efficient database queries, and using asynchronous programming to maintain a smooth user experience. 

The development of the Reports feature showcased the successful application of knowledge and skills. This component required integrating data from various parts of the app, applying complex queries, and presenting the data in a user-friendly format. It demonstrated an understanding of both the technical and user experience aspects of app development.
